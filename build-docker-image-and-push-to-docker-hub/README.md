# CI/CD Project README

This project implements Continuous Integration/Continuous Deployment (CI/CD) pipelines to automate the building and pushing of Docker images to Docker Hub. It enables developers to efficiently manage and deploy containerized applications with ease.

## Overview

The CI/CD pipeline is designed to automate the following processes:

1. Building Docker images for the application.
2. Pushing the built images to Docker Hub.
3. Triggering the pipeline on code changes in the repository.

## Technologies Used

- Docker: Containerization platform used to package the application and its dependencies into a standardized unit for software development.
- Docker Hub: Cloud-based registry service provided by Docker for storing and distributing Docker images.
- CI/CD Tool (e.g., Jenkins, GitLab CI/CD, GitHub Actions): Used to automate the building and deployment processes based on predefined triggers.

## Usage

### Prerequisites

- Docker installed on your local machine or the CI/CD server.
- Access to a Docker Hub account.

### Setup

1. Clone the repository to your local machine:

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/your-username/your-repository.git
   ```

2. Navigate to the project directory:

   ```bash
   cd your-repository
   ```

3. Configure your Docker Hub credentials:
   
   Create a `docker-credentials.env` file in the project root and add your Docker Hub username and password:

   ```env
   DOCKER_USERNAME=your-docker-username
   DOCKER_PASSWORD=your-docker-password
   ```

   **Note:** Ensure this file is added to `.gitignore` to prevent credentials leakage.

4. Update the Dockerfile if necessary to suit your application requirements.

### CI/CD Pipeline

The CI/CD pipeline is automatically triggered on each push to the `main` branch. It performs the following steps:

1. **Build Docker Image**: The Docker image is built using the Dockerfile in the project directory.

2. **Push Docker Image to Docker Hub**: Upon successful build, the image is tagged with the latest version and pushed to Docker Hub.

### Monitoring

You can monitor the status and logs of the CI/CD pipeline through the CI/CD tool's interface (e.g., Jenkins dashboard, GitLab CI/CD pipelines).

## Contributing

Contributions to improve the CI/CD pipeline or add new features are welcome! If you find any issues or have suggestions for enhancements, feel free to open an issue or submit a pull request.
