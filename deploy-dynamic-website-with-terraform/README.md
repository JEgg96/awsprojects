Terraform AWS E-commerce Website Deployment
                                    

Prerequisites
Before you begin deploying the infrastructure, make sure you have the following prerequisites set up on your local machine:

Terraform: Terraform is an essential tool for infrastructure as code (IaC). You can download it from the official Terraform website and follow the installation instructions.

AWS CLI: The AWS Command Line Interface (CLI) is necessary for interacting with your AWS account. Ensure you have the AWS CLI installed and configured with appropriate IAM user credentials that have sufficient permissions to create and manage resources on AWS.

AWS Account: You'll need an active AWS account to deploy the infrastructure. If you don't have one yet, you can sign up for an AWS account here.

Usage
Follow the steps below to deploy the e-commerce infrastructure using Terraform:

Clone the repository: Begin by cloning this repository to your local machine using the following command:

bash
Copy code
git clone https://github.com/yourusername/ecommerce-terraform.git
cd ecommerce-terraform
Initialize Terraform: Navigate to the ecommerce-terraform directory and initialize Terraform by running the following command:

bash
Copy code
terraform init
Modify Terraform Variables (Optional): Review and, if necessary, modify the terraform.tfvars file to customize deployment parameters such as AWS region, VPC CIDR blocks, database configurations, etc. This step is optional if you're satisfied with the default values.

Apply Terraform Configuration: Apply the Terraform configuration to create the e-commerce infrastructure on AWS. Execute the following command:

bash
Copy code
terraform apply
Terraform will prompt you to confirm the execution of the deployment plan. Type yes and hit Enter to proceed.

Note Terraform Outputs: After successful deployment, Terraform will display output values containing important information such as URLs, endpoint addresses, etc. Make sure to note down these outputs as they will be required to access and manage your e-commerce website.

Destroy Infrastructure (Optional): If you ever need to tear down the infrastructure, you can do so by running the following command:

bash
Copy code
terraform destroy
This command will prompt you to confirm the destruction of all resources. Type yes and hit Enter to proceed with the destruction.

Terraform Scripts
The terraform directory in this repository contains the following Terraform scripts:

main.tf: This file defines the AWS resources to be provisioned, including VPC, subnets, NAT gateways, security groups, RDS instance, SNS topic, autoscaling group, Route 53 record sets, etc.

variables.tf: In this file, you'll find the declaration of input variables used in the Terraform configuration. You can modify these variables to customize the deployment according to your requirements.

outputs.tf: Here, the output values to be displayed after successful deployment are defined. These outputs include important information such as URLs, endpoint addresses, etc.
