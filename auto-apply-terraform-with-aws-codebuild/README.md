# Continuous Integration/Continuous Deployment (CI/CD) with Terraform and GitHub

This project aims to automate the deployment of infrastructure using Terraform scripts whenever changes are made to a GitHub repository. By implementing Continuous Integration/Continuous Deployment (CI/CD) practices, it ensures rapid and reliable delivery of infrastructure changes with minimal manual intervention.

## Overview

This repository contains Terraform scripts for provisioning infrastructure on a cloud provider (e.g., AWS, Azure, GCP). The CI/CD pipeline is set up to automatically apply these Terraform scripts whenever changes are pushed to the repository.

## Features

- Automated provisioning of infrastructure using Terraform.
- CI/CD pipeline triggered by GitHub repository changes.
- Ensures consistent infrastructure deployments.
- Supports rollback in case of deployment failures.
- Provides visibility into deployment process and outcomes.

## Prerequisites

- [Terraform](https://www.terraform.io/) installed locally or available in your CI/CD environment.
- Access to a cloud provider account (e.g., AWS, Azure, GCP).
- [GitHub](https://github.com/) account for hosting your repository.

## Setup Instructions

1. Clone this repository to your local machine:

    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/your-username/your-repo.git
    ```

2. Customize the Terraform scripts according to your infrastructure requirements.

3. Configure your cloud provider credentials either through environment variables, shared credentials file, or any other method supported by Terraform.

4. Set up a CI/CD pipeline in your preferred CI/CD service (e.g., GitHub Actions, GitLab CI/CD, CircleCI) with the following steps:
   
   - Install necessary dependencies (e.g., Terraform).
   - Authenticate with your cloud provider.
   - Run Terraform commands (`terraform init`, `terraform plan`, `terraform apply`).
   - Optionally, implement rollback procedures in case of deployment failures.

5. Configure your CI/CD pipeline to trigger on changes to the repository (e.g., push events, pull requests).

6. Commit and push your changes to the GitHub repository to trigger the CI/CD pipeline.

## Usage

- Make changes to the Terraform scripts as needed for your infrastructure modifications.
- Commit and push your changes to the GitHub repository.
- Monitor the CI/CD pipeline execution for any errors or failures.
- Review the Terraform plan generated during the pipeline execution to ensure intended changes.
- Upon successful completion of the pipeline, verify that the infrastructure is provisioned as expected.
