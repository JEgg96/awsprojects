Deploy Dynamic Web App on AWS with Terraform Module, Docker, Amazon ECR, and ECS


This guide will walk you through the process of deploying a dynamic web application on Amazon Web Services (AWS) using Terraform, Docker, Amazon Elastic Container Registry (ECR), and Elastic Container Service (ECS).



Prerequisites
Before getting started, ensure you have the following prerequisites:



AWS account
Terraform installed on your local machine
Docker installed on your local machine
Basic understanding of AWS, Docker, and Terraform



Steps
1. Set up AWS credentials
Make sure you have your AWS credentials configured on your local machine. You can do this by setting environment variables or using AWS CLI aws configure.



3. Clone the repository
Clone the repository containing your web application code and Terraform configuration.


git clone <repository-url>
cd <repository-directory>

3. Dockerize your web application
Create a Dockerfile in the root directory of your project to containerize your web application. Make sure you have a working Dockerfile that builds your application into a Docker image.



4. Build and push Docker image to Amazon ECR
Follow these steps to build and push your Docker image to Amazon ECR:

bash
Copy code
# Login to ECR
$(aws ecr get-login --no-include-email --region <your-region>)

# Build Docker image
docker build -t <your-image-name> .

# Tag Docker image
docker tag <your-image-name>:latest <your-ecr-repository-url>:latest

# Push Docker image to ECR
docker push <your-ecr-repository-url>:latest
5. Terraform modules for infrastructure components
This project utilizes Terraform modules for managing various AWS resources. Below is a list of Terraform modules created for different infrastructure components:

NAT Gateway
VPC
Security Groups
RDS (Relational Database Service)
Amazon Certificate Manager (ACM) for SSL certificate
Application Load Balancer (ALB)
Amazon S3
Task Execution Role
ECS Cluster
ECS Task
Task Definition
ECS Service
ECS Auto Scaling Group
Route 53 (DNS service)
DNS record for the application
6. Initialize Terraform and deploy infrastructure
Initialize Terraform in your project directory and deploy the infrastructure:

bash
Copy code
terraform init
terraform apply
Follow the prompts to review and confirm the Terraform execution plan.

7. Access your web application
Once Terraform has successfully deployed the infrastructure, you can access your web application using the ECS service URL or the public IP address of the EC2 instance running your application.

Cleanup
To avoid incurring unnecessary charges, don't forget to destroy the Terraform-managed infrastructure once you're done:

bash
Copy code
terraform destroy
Follow the prompts to confirm the destruction of resources.

Conclusion
By following these steps, you've successfully deployed a dynamic web application on AWS using Terraform, Docker, Amazon ECR, and ECS. Feel free to customize and expand upon this setup to suit your specific requirements.
